By default some builtin slots are include for use by other modders to give a starting point of shared slots. This is done to prevent a flood of Slots with alternatives of the same concept leading to cluttered UI or introducing confusing equipment management. 

Its best to try and use the available slots starting out unless your accessory item dose not fit under the given slots below, then you can consider making your own {todo: link to such} or use the Unique Slot API {todo: link to such} if such functionality should not be shared with other mods.

## Default Implementations

Accessories attempts to add some generalized default slots to act as a starting point for mods to choose from rather than creating their own slots that may flood Accessories with alternatives of the same concept leading to cluttered UI or introducing confusing equipment management.
